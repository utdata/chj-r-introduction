## About these lessons

This lesson was written by Christian McDonald. I use a Mac so any keyboard commands that are *Cmd+whatever* might be *Ctrl+whatever* on a PC.

As we go through this week of training, we will use interactive tutorials like this one to describe and practice key concepts and then provide directions on how you can practice similar steps on your own computer.

During some practice sessions, we may ask half of the class to join a separate Zoom breakout room so that Andrew and Christian can help within smaller groups. When are are done with the practice period, we'll all return to the main R Teaching room. (When you leave the practice breakout you will return to the main fellowship session and will then need to re-join the R Teaching room.)

Here is an example interactive code block where you can write R code directly in the browser and run it. R is a programming language that allows you to do simple math, with common operators like `+`, `-`, `*` and `\`.

### Exercise 

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r two-plus-two-hint}
2 + 2
```

You'll see once you put in the answer and click **Run code** the executed answer will appear below the code chunk.

## Learning RStudio

This first day -- only an hour, really -- we'll be learning about RStudio, RMarkdown and how to use them. It's a lot of setup and not a lot of practice. I promise we'll get to the data for quickly in future sessions.

### Create a chj folder for your work

Before we even launch RStudio, I would like you to create a folder on your computer called `chj` in some place you can find it later, like in your `Documents` folder. Each new data project will have its own folder, and it would be ideal if you could create those for this class inside your `chj` folder. That way we are all on the same page.

> Break for a minute to allow folder creation.

### What is R vs RStudio

While R and RStudio are technically two programs installed on your computer, you will only really launch and use RStudio. R is the programming language, and RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) -- which is essentially a fancy code editor -- developed specifically for R programming.

There are two main ways to write an R program, either in an R script (files with a `.R` ending) or as an RNotebook (which has an `.Rmd` ending because it is written in RMarkdown.) We like using **RNotebooks** because we can interweave our code chunks with text explaining what we are tying to do. This is important as journalists because we want to be transparent about our work. It also helps us remember what the heck we were doing three weeks ago when we last used our code. *Remember, the most important audience of your code is your future self!*

### Launching RStudio

- Go ahead and launch RStudio if you haven't already.

When you launch RStudio, you will get a screen like this:

![RStudio launch screen](images/intro-start.png){width="90%"}

### Updating preferences

There is a preference in RStudio that I would like you to change. By default, the program wants to save the state of your work (all the variables and such) when you close a project, but that is not good practice. We'll change that.

- Go to the **RStudio** menu and choose **Preferences**
- Under the **General** tab, uncheck the first four boxes.
- On the option "Save Workspace to .Rdata on exit", change that to **Never**.
- Click *OK* to close the box.

![Updating preferences](images/r-preferences.png){width="90%"}

We only have to do this once for each computer.

### Starting a new Project

When we work in RStudio, we will create "Projects" to hold all the files related to one another. This sets the "working directory", which is a sort of home base for the project.

- In the top toolbar for RStudio, click on the second button that has a green `+R` sign.
- That brings up a box to create the project with several options. You want **New Directory** (unless you already have a folder for this specific project, which you don't yet)
- For **Project Type**, choose **New Project**.
- Next, for the **Directory name**, choose a new name for your project folder. For this project, use "first-project".
- For **Create project as a subdirectory of:** I want you to click on the **Browse** button and go find the `chj` folder you created earlier.

I am pretty anal-retentive about naming folders because they can become URLs in the future. It's a good programming habit.

- Use lowercase characters.
- Don't use spaces. Use dashes.

![New project screen](images/intro-newproject.png){width=90%}

When you hit **Create Project**, your RStudio window will refresh and you'll see the `first-project.Rproj` file in your Files list.


## Projects and RNotebooks

You should consider each R project as a self-contained unit. Each R session should run one project at a time. The `first-project.Rproj` file helps RStudio understand this one-project world. Every other file you need for your project should be stored inside your project folder.

For this class, we will almost always use R Notebooks. This format allows us to write text in between our blocks of code. The text is written in a language called [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), a juiced-up version of the common documentation syntax used by programmers, Markdown. It's not hard to learn.

### Create your first notebook

- Click on the button at the top-left of RStudio that has just the green `+` sign.
- Choose the item **R Notebook**.

This will open a new file with some boilerplate R Markdown code.

![R code chunk](images/intro-rcodechunk.png){width="90%"}

- At the top between the `---` marks, is the **metadata**. This is written using YAML, and what is inside are commands for the R Notebook. Don't sweat the YAML syntax too much right now, as we won't be editing it often.
- Next, you'll see a couple of paragraphs of text that describe how to use an R Notebooks. It is written in R Markdown, and has some inline links and bold commands, which you will learn.
- Then you will see an R code chunk.

Let's take a closer look at this chunk part:

- The three back-tick characters (the key found at the top left on your keyboard) followed by the `{r}` indicate that this is a chunk of R code. The last three back ticks say the code chunk is over.
- The `{r}` bit can have some parameters added to it. We'll get into that later.
- The line `plot(cars)` is R programming code. We'll see what those commands do in a bit.
- The green right-arrow to the far right is a play button to run the code that is inside the chunk.
- The green down-arrow and bar to the left of that runs all the code in the Notebook up to that point.

### Save the .Rmd file

- Do command-s or hit the floppy disk icon to save the file.
- It will ask you what you want to name this file. Call it `01-first-file.Rmd`. RStudio should already be saving this file inside your project folder.

> We named this file with `01-` at the beginning because we'll often have multiple notebooks in a project that should be run in order. Data created from one notebook might be used in another. Using this convention lets us know what order to run the notebooks.

When you do this, you may see another new file created in your Files directory with an `.html` ending. It's the pretty version of the notebook which we'll see in a minute.

In the YAML metadata portion of the file, give your notebook a better title.

- Replace "R Notebook" in the `title: "R Notebook"` code to be "Christian's first notebook", but use your name.

### Run the notebook

There is only one chunk to run in this notebook, so:

- Click on the green right-arrow to run the code.

You should get something like this:

![Cars plot](images/intro-defaultplot.png){width="90%"}

What you've done here is create a plot chart of sample data "cars" that is already embedded inside the R programming. (FWIW, it is the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. Note that the data were recorded in the 1920s.) There are other data sets like this embedded in R for examples like this.

But that wasn't a whole lot of code to see there is a relationship with speed vs stopping distance, eh?

> Let's stop here to make sure everyone has gotten to this point.

### Adding new code chunks

The text after the chart describes how to insert a new code chunk. Let's do that.

- Add a couple of returns after the paragraph of text about code chunks, but before the next bit about previews.
- Use the keys *Cmd+Option+I* to add the chunk.
- Your cursor will be inserted into the middle of the chunk. Type in this code in the space provided:

```r
# update 53 to your age
age <- 53
(age - 7) * 2
```

- Change for "53" to your real age.
- With your cursor somewhere in the code block, use the key command *Cmd+Shift+Return*, which is the key command to RUN ALL LINES of code chunk.
- NOTE: To run an individual line, use *Cmd+Return* while on that line.

Congratulations! The answer given at the bottom of that code chunk is the [socially-acceptable maximum age of anyone you should date](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201405/who-is-too-young-or-too-old-you-date).

Throwing aside whether the formula is sound, let's break down the code.

- `# update 53 to your age` is a comment. It's a way to explain what is happening in the code without being considered part of the code.
- `age <- 53` is assigning a number (`53`) to a variable name (`age`). A variable is a placeholder. It can hold numbers, text or even groups of numbers. Variables are key to programming because they allow you to change a value as you go along. In R we use an arrow (or dash and angle bracket) to show which direction we are assigning the value, but convention is to name the variable first, then assign from the right.
- Pro tip: You can use **option -** to type in the `<-` assigning operator.
- The next part is simple math: `(age - 7) * 2` takes the value of `age` and subtracts `7`, then multiplies by `2`. You might have noticed that the editor helped you by adding closing `)` and putting your cursor in the middle. If you've never used a code editor, help like this can be confusing at first, but you'll learn to love it.
- When you run the code chucnk, you get the result of the math equation below it, `[1] 92` in my case. That means there was one observation, and the value was "92". For the record, my wife is _much_ younger than that.

Now you can play with the number assigned to the age variable to test out different ages. Do that.

> We'll break here to make sure everyone is good.

### A note on RMarkdown and clean code

When writing RMarkdown in an RNotebook, you want an empty blank line between each major element: code block, headline, or paragraph of text.

Headlines are indicated with a hashtag at the beginning. The more hashtags there are, the smaller the headline (I know, it's counter-intuitive, but it matches HTML headlines.) In RMarkdown, the singe-hashtag headline is the title, so the next biggest headline you should use is two hashes:

```md

## This is the biggest headline you should add

This is text.

This is a new paragraph.

### A smaller headline as subhead to the one above

This text is related to the above in some way.
```

Also make sure you have blank lines above and below each code chunk.

### Preview the report

The rest of the boilerplate text here describes how you can *Preview* and *Knit* a notebook. Let's do that now.

- Press *Cmd+Shift+K* to open a Preview.

This will open a new window and show you the "pretty" notebook that we are building.

Preview is a little different than *Knit*, which runs all the code, then creates the new knitted HTML document. **Knit to HMTL** creates an HTML document that you can send to others, or publish on Github with some additional YAML configurations. You can also Knit to PDFs.

### The toolbar

One last thing to point out with RStudio before we move on is the toolbar that runs across the top of the R Notebook file window. The image below explains some of the more useful tools, but you _REALLY_ should learn and use keyboard commands when they are available.

![R Notebook toolbar](images/intro-toolbar.png){width=90%}

## The tidyverse and R packages

While "base" R is a robust programming language on its own, the true power lies in a community of that writes "packages" to do new things easier and better. A R users, we "install" the code for these packages into RStudio to make their functions available to us.

The pièce de résistance of packages is the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), as collection of packages for data science that were all written to work together. Hadley Wickham is one of the main developers, and wrote [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)

![Hadley Wickham holds court at IRE 2019 in Houston](images/hadley.jpg){width=90%}

### Install the tidyverse

Let's install the tidyverse on your machines.

- Open the **Console** at the bottom of your RStudio window.
- Type in `install.packages("tidyverse")` and hit return.

You'll see your computer work away and eventually come to a success message saying where the packages were installed. You only have to do this once for your computer.

When we install packages, we put the package name in quotes because R doesn't "have" what it is looking for yet and has to look for it. When in set libraries later, we won't use the quotes.

### Install janitor and readr

There are two other packages we are going to install and we'll do it at one time, learning about `c()` along the way.

- In your **Console**, run: `install.packages(c("janitor","readxl"))`

- [janitor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html) has some data cleaning properties we'll use.
- [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/read_excel.html) is a tidyverse add-on to import Excel files.

You'll note we used this `c("term1","term1")` construction to feed R a combination of items, which you'll see a lot. The `c` stands for **combine** and we use it to build collections of things we call **vectors**.

*BORING DETAILS:* [**Vectors**](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_vectors.htm) are collections of elements of like value, like numbers or strings of letters. Everything is a vector in R, really -- a single letter in R is a vector with a length of 1. I would say think of vectors like a list of common things, but a [list](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_lists.htm) is a special object of its own, a combination of unlike things.

### Using libraries

We're going to start our next RNotebook and set up some of these libraries.

- In the first top toolbar icon, choose RNotebook.
- In the YAML at the top of the file, change the metadata **title** to "MN Opioid deaths" as that is what we'll be working with.
- Delete everything after the `---` on the 4th line.
- Save the file and name it **01-opioid-clean.Rmd**. (We named with `01-` since this is also the first in a series of notebooks that may work together.)
- Lastly, make sure you have a full blank line after the YAML metadata and add a new code chuck with *Cmd+Option+I*.

Inside this code chunk we are going to add the libraries we'll use for this next lesson:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

When you run that chunk of code, you might see this output in your Console:

```r
> library(tidyverse)
package ‘tidyverse’ was built under R version 4.0.2Registered S3 methods overwritten by 'dbplyr':

```

## Importing data

OK, let's get to some data, shall we?

### Importing with readr

The tidyverse package [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) (included in the tidyverse library) is our workhorse for importing and exporting of data. There are other tidyverse specialty packages like [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html) and [readxl]([readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/read_excel.html)) and some alternatives like  [rio](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rio/).

To save some time we're going to import csv data that is stored on the internet.

Let's practice this first in the tutorial so you see how it works, then you can do it in your project.

```{r prepare-opioid, include=FALSE}
```

Here we have the data imported as "opioid", but will start looking at it. (The dataframe is called opioid even if you named it something else above.)

```{r opioid-read, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-opioid"}
read_csv("https://github.com/utdata/chj-r-introduction/blob/main/data/chj_mn_opiate_deaths_data.csv?raw=true")
```

```{r opioid-assign, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-opioid"}
opioid <- read_csv("https://github.com/utdata/chj-r-introduction/blob/main/data/chj_mn_opiate_deaths_data.csv?raw=true")
```

```{r opioid-assign-hint}
opioid <- read_csv("https://github.com/utdata/chj-r-introduction/blob/main/data/chj_mn_opiate_deaths_data.csv?raw=true")
opioid
```

- clean names with janitor
- get `summary()` and use pipe

### The pipe

One of the tenets of the tidyverse is the use of the pipe: ` %>% ` which takes the result of the previous operation and "pipes" it into the next operation. It makes for more readable code than the nested syntax of base R, so much so I don't even teach base R that much.

### Getting help

- The help function
- Good Googling techniques

### Quick summary of your data


```{r}
covid %>% summary()
```


*Stuff here.*

But here is other stuff.

## Exporting data

## learnr examples

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```



### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```


### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
