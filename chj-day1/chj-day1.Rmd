## About these lessons

This lesson was written by Christian McDonald. I use a Mac so any keyboard commands that are *Cmd-whatever* are usually *Control-whatever* on a PC.

As we go through this week of training, we will use interactive tutorials like this one to describe and practice key concepts and then provide directions on how you can practice similar steps on your own computer.

During some practice sessions, we may ask half of the class to join a separate Zoom breakout room so that Andrew and Christian can help within smaller groups. When are are done with the practice period, we'll all return to the main R Teaching room. (When you leave the practice breakout you will return to the main fellowship session and will then need to re-join the R Teaching room.)

Here is an example interactive code block where you can write R code directly in the browser and run it. R is a programming language that allows you to do simple math, with common operators like `+`, `-`, `*` and `\`.

### Exercise 

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r two-plus-two-hint}
2 + 2
```

You'll see once you put in the answer and click **Run code** the executed answer will appear below the code chunk.

## Learning RStudio


### Create a chj folder for your work

Before we even launch RStudio, I would like you to create a folder on your computer called `chj` in some place you can find it later, like in your `Documents` folder. Each new data project will have its own folder, and it would be ideal if you could create those for this class inside your `chj` folder. That way we are all on the same page.

> Break for a minute to allow folder creation.

### What is R vs RStudio

While R and RStudio are technically two programs installed on your computer, you will only really launch and use RStudio. R is the programming language, and RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) -- which is essentially a fancy code editor -- developed specifically for R programming.

There are two main ways to write an R program, either in an R script (files with a `.R` ending) or as an RNotebook (which has an `.Rmd` ending because it is written in RMarkdown.) We like using **RNotebooks** because we can interweave our code chunks with text explaining what we are tying to do. This is important as journalists because we want to be transparent about our work. It also helps us remember what the heck we were doing three weeks ago when we last used our code. *Remember, the most important audience of your code is your future self!*

### Launching RStudio

- Go ahead and launch RStudio if you haven't already.

When you launch RStudio, you will get a screen like this:

![RStudio launch screen](images/intro-start.png){width="90%"}

### Updating preferences

There is a preference in RStudio that I would like you to change. By default, the program wants to save a the state of your work (all the variables and such) when you close a project, but that is not good practice. We'll change that.

- Go to the **RStudio** menu and choose **Preferences**
- Under the **General** tab, uncheck the first four boxes.
- On the option "Save Workspace to .Rdata on exit", change that to **Never**.
- Click *OK* to close the box.

![Updating preferences](images/r-preferences.png){width="90%"}

We only have to do this once for each computer.

### Starting a new Project

When we work in RStudio, we will create "Projects" to hold all the files related to one another. This sets the "working directory", which is a sort of home base for the project.

- Click on the second button that has a green `+R` sign.
- That brings up a box to create the project with several options. You want **New Directory** (unless you already have a folder for this specific project, which you don't yet)
- For **Project Type**, choose **New Project**.
- Next, for the **Directory name**, choose a new name for your project folder. For this project, use "first-project".
- For **Create project as a subdirectory of:** I want you to click on the **Browse** button and go find the `chj` folder you created earlier.

I am pretty anal-retentive about naming folders because they can become URLs in the future. It's a good programming habit.

- Use lowercase characters.
- Don't use spaces. Use dashes.

> UPDATE screenshot of new project here.

![New project screen](images/intro-newproject.png){width=90%}

When you hit **Create Project**, your RStudio window will refresh and you'll see the `first-project.Rproj` file in your Files list.


## Projects and RNotebooks

You should consider each R project as a self-contained unit. Each R session should run one project at a time. The `first-project.Rproj` file helps RStudio understand this one-project world. Every other file you need for your project should be stored inside your project folder.

For this class, we will almost always use R Notebooks. This format allows us to write text in between our blocks of code. The text is written in a language called [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), a juiced-up version of the common documentation syntax used by programmers, Markdown. It's not hard to learn.

### Create your first notebook

- Click on the button at the top-left of RStudio that has just the green `+` sign.
- Choose the item **R Notebook**.

This will open a new file with some boilerplate R Markdown code.

- At the top between the `---` marks, is the **metadata**. This is written using YAML, and what is inside are commands for the R Notebook. Don't sweat the YAML syntax too much right now, as we won't be editing it often.
- Next, you'll see a couple of paragraphs of text that describes how to use an R Notebooks. It is written in R Markdown, and has some inline links and bold commands, which you will learn.
- Then you will see an R code chunk that looks like the figure below.

> UPDATE this screenshot to include the YAML

![R code chunk](images/intro-rcodechunk.png){width="90%"}

Let's take a closer look at this:

- The three back-tick characters (the key found at the top left on your keyboard) followed by the `{r}` indicate that this is a chunk of R code. The last three back ticks say the code chunk is over.
- The `{r}` bit can have some parameters added to it. We'll get into that later.
- The line `plot(cars)` is R programming code. We'll see what those commands do in a bit.
- The green right-arrow to the far right is a play button to run the code that is inside the chunk.
- The green down-arrow and bar to the left of that runs all the code in the Notebook up to that point.

### Save the .Rmd file

- Do command-s or hit the floppy disk icon to save the file.
- It will ask you what you want to name this file. Call it `01-first-file.Rmd`. RStudio should already be saving this file inside your project folder.

> We named this file with `01-` at the beginning because we'll often have multiple notebooks in a project that should be run in order. Data created from one notebook might be used in another. Using this convention lets us know what order to run the notebooks.

When you do this, you may see another new file created in your Files directory with an `.html` ending. It's the pretty version of the notebook which we'll see in a minute.

In the YAML metadata portion of the file, give your notebook a better title.

- Replace "R Notebook" in the `title: "R Notebook"` code to be "Christian's first notebook", but use your name.

### Run the notebook

There is only one chunk to run in this notebook, so:

- Click on the green right-arrow to run the code.

You should get something like this:

![Cars plot](images/intro-defaultplot.png){width="90%"}

What you've done here is create a plot chart of sample data "cars" that is already embedded inside the R programming. (FWIW, It is the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. Note that the data were recorded in the 1920s.) There are other data sets like this embedded in R for examples like this.

But that wasn't a whole lot of code to see there is a relationship with speed vs stopping distance, eh?

> Let's stop here to make sure everyone has gotten to this point.

### Adding new code chunks

The text after the chart describes how to insert a new code chunk. Let's do that.

- Add a couple of returns after the paragraph of text about code chunks, but before the next bit about previews.
- Use the keys *Cmd+Option+I* to add the chunk.
- Your cursor will be inserted into the middle of the chunk. Type in this code in the space provided:

```r
# update 53 to your age
age <- 53
(age - 7) * 2
```

- Change for "53" to your real age.
- With your cursor somewhere in the code block, use the key command *Cmd+Shift+Return*, which is the key command to RUN ALL LINES of code chunk.
- NOTE: To run an individual line, use *Cmd+Return* while on that line.

Congratulations! The answer given at the bottom of that code chunk is the [socially-acceptable maximum age of anyone you should date](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201405/who-is-too-young-or-too-old-you-date).

Throwing aside whether the formula is sound, let's break down the code.

- `# update 53 to your age` is a comment. It's a way to explain what is happening in the code without being considered part of the code.
- `age <- 53` is assigning a number (`53`) to a variable name (`age`). A variable is a placeholder. It can hold numbers, text or even groups of numbers. Variables are key to programming because they allow you to change a value as you go along.
- The next part is simple math: `(age - 7) * 2` takes the value of `age` and subtracts `7`, then multiplies by `2`.
- When you run it, you get the result of the math equation, `[1] 92` in my case. That means there was one observation, and the value was "92". For the record, my wife is _much_ younger than that.

Now you can play with the number assigned to the age variable to test out different ages. Do that.

> We'll break here to make sure everyone is good.

### A note on RMarkdown and clean code

When writing RMarkdown in an RNotebook, you want a blank line between each major element: code block, headline, paragraph of text.

Headlines are indicated with a hashtag at the beginning. The more hashtags there are, the smaller the headline (I know, it's counter-intuitive, but it matches HTML headlines.) In RMarkdown, the singe-hashtag headline is the title, so the next biggest headline you should use is two hashes:

```md

## This is the biggest headline you should add

This is text.

This is a new paragraph.

### A smaller headline as subhead to the one above

This text is related to the above in some way.
```

Also make sure you have blank lines above and below each code chunk.

## The tidyverse and R packages

- Describe the tidyverse
- Install the tidyverse
- Also install janitor

---
- Add the library "janitor" to the setup chunk below

```{r libraries, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r libraries-hint}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

## Importing data

- Start a new notebook: 02-opiod-deaths.Rmd
- Add libraries
- Create a data folder
- Download our test data

---

```{r import-exercise, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
opioid <- read_csv("chj_mn_opiate_deaths_data.csv")

```

Go to [this URL]() and then click on download.


*Stuff here.*

But here is other stuff.

## Exporting data

## learnr examples

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```



### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```


### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
