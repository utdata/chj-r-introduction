## Download these files

Hopefully, you've created folder on your computer, maybe in your Documents folder called "CHJ" or something like that.

Once you've set your working directory (with maybe `setwd()`) then you can run these commands in your console to download the correct folders and data:

`install.packages("usethis")`

and then

`usethis::use_course("https://github.com/utdata/chj-r-introduction/archive/main.zip")`
