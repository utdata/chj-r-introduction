## Download this tutorial

While some of these lessons are hosted online, some are not, so it is perhaps best to download this repository and run the code on your own computer.

- Go to the green **Code** button at the top of this page and click on the dropdown there.
- Use the **Download ZIP** option to download to your machine.
- Uncompress the files and move the resulting folder to a safe place on your hard drive.
- Open RStudio and go under File to **Open Project**. Go to the downloaded/moved folder and open the .Rproj file.
- Inside of each day's folder, you can open the `index.Rmd` file and click **Run Document** in the Rmarkdown toolbar. A document will open that you can work through.

I you want to simultaneously work on your own project folder, you'll have to go under File to **Open Project in New Session**.

## Online tutorials for each day

These are admittedly really buggy. Go slow. If you get an error or a timeout on a code chunk, use **Start over** in the chunk and try again. If that fails, use **Start over** in the navigation and try again.

- [Day 2: Data wrangling](http://chj-r.cmcdonald.com:3838/chj-day2/)
- [Day 3, Pt. 1: Combining data](http://chj-r.cmcdonald.com:3838/chj-day3-p1/)

After this point, it's probably best to use the downloaded data.
