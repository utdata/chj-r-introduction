# Center for Health Journalism: R Introduction

A course by Andrew Ba Tran & Christian McDonald for the [Center for Health Journalism Data Fellowship](https://centerforhealthjournalism.org/event/2020-data-fellowship-1).

## Outline

Idea is to tackle each section in three parts:

- Short discussion on concepts.
- A [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) tutorial to practice the steps.
- A detailed practice session for the fellow to do on their own.

We can use some COVID data, including from the [covidcast](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/) package.

## Task breakdown

### Christian

- Install R and RStudio (to do before conference)
  - Also might walk through getting Census API key
- Project management for RStudio
- Import/Exporting data (readr, etc)
- Data Wrangling (dplyr)

I'll also apply for a shinnyapps.io educational account.

### Andrew

In addition to below, figure out how to publish to the shinyapps.io.

- Shaping data (tidyr)
- Visualizations (ggplot)
- Census
- Geoanalysis with census/maps
